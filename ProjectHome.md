Peer Block is a new version (aka a "fork") of the popular Peer Guardian 2 software.  It blocks "known bad" computers from accessing yours, for example governments and corporations.  Peer Block maintains the functionality of the original Peer Guardian 2 program, but includes fixes for various Windows Vista / Windows 7 issues that remain unaddressed in PG2.

Main website for this project is [here](http://www.peerblock.com).

**Note on License:**  Please note that the Peer Block source code is _NOT_ necessarily released under the GPL, regardless of what the little sidebar says.  The original source code for Peer Guardian 2 was licensed under a "zlib/libpng License", and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to relicense it under the terms of that license.  Google Code does not however allow "zlib/libpng" as an option, but as the [PG2 SourceForge.net project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peerguardian/) states both GPL and zlib/libpng licenses I figured I'd pick the one of those two that Google Code offers.
